# Object Detection with YOLO

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is extremely fast and accurate.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the YOLO implementation.
- `coco.names/`: Directory for datasets used in detection.
- `yolov4.weights/`: Pre-trained weights for the YOLO model.
- `yolov4.cfg/`: Configuration files for model and detection settings.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-object-detection.git](https://github.com/oussama458/D-tection-d-Objets)

2. Install dependencies
3. Run the python code
